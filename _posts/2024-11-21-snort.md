# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with Snort as an example

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84542b6f-be5d-4e9f-ad2e-b47ac1f523f0)

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a passive monitoring solution designed to detect possible malicious activities, abnormal incidents, and policy violations. Its primary function is to generate alerts whenever suspicious events are identified.

### Types of IDS:
1. **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**  
   - Monitors network traffic flow across various areas of the network.  
   - Investigates the traffic of the entire subnet.  
   - Generates alerts when predefined signatures are identified.

2. **Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)**  
   - Monitors traffic flow on a single endpoint device.  
   - Investigates traffic on that particular device.  
   - Creates alerts for suspicious activity based on matching signatures.

---

## Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
An **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** is an active protection solution designed to stop malicious activities, abnormal incidents, and policy violations as soon as they are detected. It actively prevents threats by terminating suspicious activities.

### Types of IPS:
1. **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)**  
   - Monitors network traffic across various areas.  
   - Protects the entire subnet by terminating connections when malicious activity is detected.

2. **Behavior-based Intrusion Prevention System (NBA)**  
   - Monitors traffic to detect anomalies.  
   - Requires a training period (baselining) to learn "normal" traffic behavior.  
   - Differentiates between malicious and benign traffic more effectively, especially against new threats.

3. **Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS)**  
   - Monitors traffic in wireless networks.  
   - Protects wireless traffic and blocks attacks originating from wireless networks.

4. **Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)**  
   - Actively protects traffic on a single endpoint device.  
   - Unlike HIDS, it terminates connections instead of just creating alerts.

## Detection and Prevention with Snort
**Snort** is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It is maintained by Martin Roesch, open-source contributors, and the Cisco Talos team.

### Capabilities of Snort:
- Live traffic analysis
- Attack and probe detection
- Packet logging
- Protocol analysis
- Real-time alerting
- Extensibility through modules and plugins
- Cross-platform support (Linux and Windows)

### Snort Modes:
1. **Sniffer Mode**  
   Reads IP packets and displays them in the console.

2. **Packet Logger Mode**  
   Logs all IP packets that pass through the network.

3. **NIDS/NIPS Modes**  
   Detects and drops packets based on user-defined rules.

## How to Use Snort
### Installing Snort
To install Snort we have to use the following command:

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/168f261e-b3f6-43db-a235-f33629ee2bc5)

Now we can find Snort in /etc/snort folder, that's how it looks like:

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11fd710a-13eb-4394-b985-2014b872b03b)

In the rules folder we can see many various rules:

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4d6a3bf-41ff-4661-b49e-0bcd9d4e20a7)

The rules that we will create will be present in local.rules

### Sniffer Mode:
Options we have when it comes to sniffer mode:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -V / --version| This parameter provides information about your instance version.           |
| -c            | Identifying the configuration file.                                        |
| -T            | Snort's self-test parameter, you can test your setup with this parameter.  |
| -q            | Quiet mode prevents Snort from displaying the default banner and initial setup information.|

To run Snort in sniffer mode on the `eth0` interface:  
Lets start snort in verbose mode on eth0 interface:
```bash
sudo snort -v -i eth0
```

Just a basing Packet Sniffer.

### Packet Logger mode
You can use Snort as a sniffer and log the sniffed packets via logger mode. You only need to use the packet logger mode parameters, and Snort does the rest to accomplish this.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-l`       | Logger mode: Target log and alert output directory. Default output folder is `/var/log/snort`. |
| `-K ASCII` | Logs packets in ASCII format.                                                                   |
| `-r`       | Reads the dumped logs in Snort.                                                                 |
| `-n`       | Specifies the number of packets to process or read. Stops after reading the specified amount.   |

Lets start snort in packet logger mode
```bash
sudo snort -dev -l .
```
It generated us the log file:

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/305279ea-1f86-45ea-a3dd-a42d4ecbaef9)

We can explore the file to look for some malicious traffic but its not our goal of today.

### Snort in IDS/IPS mode.
Now the main part. Let's use Snort in IDS or IPS mode.

| Parameter | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-c`      | Defines the configuration file.                                                                       |
| `-T`      | Tests the configuration file.                                                                         |
| `-N`      | Disables logging.                                                                                     |
| `-D`      | Enables background mode.                                                                              |
| `-A`      | Specifies alert modes:                                                                                |
|           | `full` - Full alert mode with all possible information (default).                                     |
|           | `fast` - Fast mode shows alert message, timestamp, source/destination IP, and port numbers.           |
|           | `console` - Fast-style alerts on the console screen.                                                  |
|           | `cmg` - CMG style with basic header details and payload in hex and text format.                       |
|           | `none` - Disables alerting entirely.                                                                  |

Let's run Snort in the background:

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b17fa22a-8475-41db-8987-bce20d0b170c)

Note that daemon mode is mainly used to automate the Snort. This parameter is mainly used in scripts to start the Snort service in the background. It is not recommended to use this mode unless you have a working knowledge of Snort and stable configuration.

Console mode provides fast style alerts on the console screen. Start the Snort instance in console alert mode (-A console ) with the following command:

```bash
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console
```

### IPS mode and dropping packets
IPS mode and dropping packets 
Snort IPS mode activated with -Q --daq afpacket parameters. You can also activate this mode by editing snort.conf file. 

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8e56f01-b077-4ddb-830b-9e9591885682)

As you can see it is now dropping ICMP packets.

### Snort Rule Format

The best way to present the format of the rule is on [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com)

![obraz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a3652c1-3d6a-43ef-9ee2-833ed3df7df3)

There are several actions for rules. Make sure you understand the functionality and test it before creating rules for live systems. The most common actions are listed below. 

| Action     | Description                                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `alert`    | Generates an alert and logs the packet.                                                               |
| `log`      | Logs the packet.                                                                                      |
| `drop`     | Blocks and logs the packet.                                                                           |
| `reject`   | Blocks the packet, logs it, and terminates the session.                                               |

| Protocol   | Description                                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Supported  | Snort supports `IP`, `TCP`, `UDP`, and `ICMP`.                                                       |
| Detection  | Detect application flows using port numbers (e.g., filter FTP on port 21).                            |

**IP and Port Numbers**
These parameters identify source and destination IP address and associated port numbers for the rule:

| Filtering Type         | Rule Example                                                                                 | Description                                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IP Filtering           | `alert icmp 192.168.1.56 any <> any any (msg: "ICMP Packet From"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)`     | Alerts for ICMP packets from `192.168.1.56`.                                               |
| Filter IP Range        | `alert icmp 192.168.1.0/24 any <> any any (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)`  | Alerts for ICMP packets from the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet.                                  |
| Exclude IPs            | `alert icmp !192.168.1.0/24 any <> any any (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)` | Excludes alerts for ICMP packets from `192.168.1.0/24`.                                    |
| Port Filtering         | `alert tcp any any <> any 21 (msg: "FTP Port 21 Command Activity Detected"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)` | Alerts for TCP packets sent to port `21`.                                                 |
| Exclude Specific Port  | `alert tcp any any <> any !21 (msg: "No FTP Traffic on Port 21"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)`     | Excludes alerts for TCP packets sent to port `21`.                                         |
| Filter Port Range      | `alert tcp any any <> any 1:1024 (msg: "TCP 1-1024 Port Activity"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)`    | Alerts for TCP packets sent to ports `1-1024`.                                             |

Write a rule to filter IP ID "35369" and run it against the given pcap file.

**alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"IP packet with IP ID 35369 detected"; id:35369; sid:1000001; rev:1;)**

**Points to remember**

### Main Components of Snort

- **Packet Decoder**: Collects and prepares packets for pre-processing.  
- **Pre-processors**: Arranges and modifies packets for the detection engine.  
- **Detection Engine**: Analyzes packets by applying rules.  
- **Logging and Alerting**: Handles log and alert generation.  
- **Outputs and Plugins**: Integrates outputs (e.g., syslog/MySQL) and supports plugins for rule management and detection.

### Types of Rules in Snort

1. **Community Rules**:  
   - Free ruleset under GPLv2.  
   - Publicly accessible without registration.  

2. **Registered Rules**:  
   - Free ruleset requiring registration.  
   - Includes subscriber rules with a 30-day delay.  

3. **Subscriber Rules (Paid)**:  
   - Paid ruleset requiring a subscription.  
   - Updated twice weekly (Tuesdays and Thursdays).  

More information and downloads for these rules can be found [here](#).

---

### Configuration Notes

- Snort2 creates required directories and files during installation.  
- For community or paid rules, add each rule to the `snort.conf` file.  
- Avoid replacing the configured Snort files.  
- Use tools or modules to update rules to prevent crashes or misconfigurations.  

### Key Files
- **`snort.conf`**: Main configuration file.  
- **`local.rules`**: User-generated rules file for detection and rule paths.
