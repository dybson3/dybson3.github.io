# Yara

In the world of cybersecurity, tools that can swiftly and accurately identify malicious files are invaluable. Yara, often described as *"the pattern matching Swiss knife for malware researchers (and everyone else)"* (VirusTotal, 2020), is one such tool. Its ability to identify patterns—whether binary, hexadecimal, or textual—makes it indispensable for malware analysts and incident responders alike.

## What is Yara?

Yara is a versatile tool used to identify and classify files based on patterns defined in **rules**. These rules analyze files for specific characteristics, such as strings or binary sequences, to determine whether they exhibit malicious behavior.

For example, a Yara rule can be written to detect the string `"Hello World!"` in every file on your system. This is particularly useful because malware often contains strings representing critical information like ransom notes, command-and-control server IP addresses, or Bitcoin wallet IDs.

## Why Malware Uses Strings

Malware, like legitimate programs, uses strings to store data. These strings can reveal a lot about the malware’s intent and functionality. Here are a few examples:

| **Type**       | **Data**                        | **Description**                                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Ransomware** | `12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw` | Bitcoin wallet for ransom payments               |
| **Botnet**     | `12.34.56.7`                    | IP address of the Command-and-Control server     |

## Writing Yara Rules

Let's create our first Yara rule:
```bash
cmnatic@thm nano myfirstrule.yar   GNU nano 4.8 myfirstrule.yar
```
```yara
rule examplerule {
        condition: true
}
```
Now if we run our rule we are gonna see it detected a file that matched the rule:
```bash
cmnatic@thm:~$ yara myfirstrule.yar somefile 
examplerule somefile
```

Yara rules are easy to learn but challenging to master. Every rule must have a **name** and a **condition**. Here's a basic example of a Yara rule that searches for the string `"Hello World!"`:

```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"

    condition:
        $hello_world
}
```
This rule will match any file containing the exact string "Hello World!". To make it case-insensitive or match multiple variations, you can define additional strings and use the any of them condition:
```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"
        $hello_world_lowercase = "hello world"
        $hello_world_uppercase = "HELLO WORLD"

    condition:
        any of them
}
```
Now, any file containing "Hello World!", "hello world", or "HELLO WORLD" will trigger the rule.

**Advanced Conditions**
Yara supports various operators to create complex conditions, such as:

    Comparison Operators: <=, >=, !=
    Logical Operators: and, or, not

For example, the rule below matches files containing "Hello World!" and are smaller than 10 KB:
```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"

    condition:
        $hello_world and filesize < 10KB
}
```
## Integrating Yara with Other Tools

Yara becomes even more powerful when integrated with other libraries and frameworks:

### Cuckoo Sandbox

Cuckoo Sandbox is an automated malware analysis tool that generates Yara rules based on observed malware behavior. By running suspicious files in a controlled environment, analysts can create Yara rules that detect specific runtime patterns.

### Python PE Module

Python's PE module allows Yara rules to analyze Windows PE files, identifying patterns in executables and DLLs. This is particularly useful for identifying cryptographic or worming behavior in malware without reverse engineering.

## Open-Source Yara Tools

You don’t need to write every rule from scratch! Several tools and repositories can help you leverage Yara:

### LOKI

LOKI, created by Florian Roth, is an open-source IOC scanner that uses Yara rules. It supports detection through:

- File Name IOC Check  
- Yara Rule Check  
- Hash Check  
- Command-and-Control (C2) Back Connect Check  

An example of **LOKI** running:

### Valhalla

Valhalla is an online Yara feed by Nextron-Systems (also by Florian Roth). It provides thousands of high-quality, handcrafted Yara rules to boost detection capabilities. It’s a must-have resource for anyone using Yara in incident response.

## Conclusion

Yara is a powerful and flexible tool for identifying malicious files based on patterns. With its extensive rule capabilities and integration options, it remains a go-to solution for malware researchers and security analysts. Whether you’re hunting threats or analyzing unknown files, Yara is an essential tool in the cybersecurity arsenal.
