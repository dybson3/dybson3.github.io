## Projects
### [SOC Automation Project](https://github.com/dybson3/SOC-Automation-Lab)
This project demonstrates how to automate common SOC tasks using **Wazuh**, **Shuffle**, and **TheHive** to detect and respond to suspicious activities. It includes workflows for incident detection, alert management, and enriching data through threat intelligence tools.

### [Active Directory Lab](https://github.com/dybson3/Active-Directory-Lab)
The Active Directory Lab project is a cybersecurity simulation designed to mimic a typical enterprise environment for security monitoring and incident response training. This setup includes a network of virtual machines—**Kali Linux** for offensive testing, **Windows 10**, **Windows Server** for Active Directory, and **Ubuntu** for hosting the **Splunk** server. Tools like **Splunk**, **Sysmon**, **Hydra**, and **Atomic Red Team** were used to simulate and detect attacks.

### [Forage Internship Mastercard](https://github.com/dybson3/Forage-Internship-Mastercard)
A job simulation where I Created a phishing campaign and a presentation to spread awareness about phishing.

### [Forage Internship AIG](https://github.com/dybson3/Forage-Internship-AIG)
A job simulation at AIG. I had two task. First one was to discover a Log4j vulnerability and educate the teams in virtual company about the threats and mitigation the danger. The second task was to conduct a brute force attack to extract zip file to get the flag. To conduct this task I created a simple Python script.
